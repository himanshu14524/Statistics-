    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores: {70, 75, 80, 85, 90}. The mean score is 80. The variance would be calculated by taking the squared differences between each score and the mean, then averaging them.\n",

    "It is widely used due to its intuitive interpretation and its property of being in the same units as the data.\n",
